##  Overview

Micro-wildfires pose critical threats to ecosystems and communities, yet are often missed by large-scale fire monitoring systems. This project proposes an AI-based framework combining **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **LSTMs**, and **Random Forests** using fused data from satellite imagery, weather systems, and sensor networks.

Key innovations include:
- **92% accuracy** using CNNs on spatial data
- GAN-based **bias mitigation** improving Equalized Odds from 0.21 → 0.05
- Edge deployment with **TensorFlow Lite** for IoT-based fire prevention

---

##  AI & ML Models Used

-  **Random Forest**: Interpretable, robust to missing data  
- ⚡ **XGBoost**: Efficient and high-performing decision trees  
-  **CNN**: Spatial feature extraction from satellite imagery  
- ⏱ **LSTM**: Sequential prediction of wildfire progression  

---

##  Dataset Sources (Used in Full Research)

- **MODIS Active Fire (NASA FIRMS)**
- **NOAA Weather Data**: Temp, humidity, wind speed
- **Ground Sensor Data**: Smoke, gas, thermal readings

> ⚠ _Note: The GitHub notebook uses **synthetic sample data** for illustration only. The research paper is based on real, publicly available data._

##  Key Results

| Model        | Accuracy | AUC   | Best Use Case              |
|--------------|----------|-------|-----------------------------|
| CNN          | 92%      | 0.94  | Satellite-based imagery     |
| LSTM         | 89%      | 0.91  | Sequential time series      |
| Random Forest| 87%      | 0.89  | Feature importance + small data |

 Bias Mitigation:
- Equalized Odds ↓ from 0.21 → **0.05**
- Demographic Parity ↓ from 0.18 → **0.02**

## ⚖️ Fairness and Equity

This project emphasizes equitable technology for wildfire detection by:
- Implementing **bias-aware models** (AIF360, GANs)
- Enhancing accuracy in **underrepresented regions**
- Measuring fairness using **Equalized Odds** and **Statistical Parity**

---

##  Edge AI & Deployment

- Converted LSTM model to **TensorFlow Lite**
- Supports deployment on **IoT sensor devices**
- Suitable for rural, disconnected, or wildfire-prone zones

---

##  Future Enhancements

- Integrate **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for better spatial features
- Use **drone-based LiDAR and thermal sensors**
- Deploy via **Federated Learning** for privacy and scale
