Micro-wildfires, though frequently overlooked, can be very dangerous to ecosys-
tems, infrastructure, and public safety—in particular, the increased speed of cli-
mate change makes the situation worse. Detection systems, in particular, focus
on large-scale fires and neglect to identify rapidly escalating smaller outbreaks. In
this study, an AI-based framework is developed to predict micro-wildfires by fusing
satellite imagery, weather data, and sensor data. The evaluation also incorporates
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks
(LSTMs), as well as traditional ML models such as Logistic Regression, Random
Forest, and XGBoost. CNNs achieved 92% accuracy and AUC of 0.94 , while
LSTMs achieved 89% based on modeling temporal dependencies. Random For-
est performed best on smaller datasets due to optimal precision.
To advance equity, bias mitigation techniques such as GAN-based data aug-
mentation and demographic parity algorithms were applied, resulting in reduc-
ing the Equalized Odds disparity from 0.21 to 0.05 [9]. Cross-validation across
wildfire-prone regions—including California, Australia, and the Mediterranean—
demonstrated the framework’s generalizability. The combined edge and cloud-based
adaptation of the AI system enhanced the scalability, accessibility, and adaptability
to these high-risk regions for proactive, equitable wildfire detection and response.
This work seeks to address the dual goals of protecting human life as well as
the ecosystem, motivated by my desire to mitigate the economic repercussions of
wildfires and my dedication to the responsible development of AI.
